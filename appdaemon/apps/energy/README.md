# ha-energy
This is an AppDaemon automation of my Tibber energy monitoring in Home Assistant. 

# why
It provides additional information such as:
- Electricity price with and without VAT & Energy factor (energiledd)
- Real time kWh price with compensation from the Norwegian goverment, based on the current monthly average price.


# Installation

1. This requires AppDeamon installed and configured (follow the documentation on their web site).
2. Make sure that `datetime` are incuded in the `python_packages` option
3. Copy the content of the energy directory from this repository to your home assistant `/config/appdaemon` folder
4. Add configuration to your Home Assistant's `/config/appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml`
